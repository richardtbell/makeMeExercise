* Position yourself bent forward in front of a bench while holding a dumbbell with one hand (arm extended).
* Lift the dumbbell up until your upper arm is parallel to your body and lower it back after a short pause. Alternate hands when set is completed.
* Try to keep your back straight throughout. Only the arm should move.
