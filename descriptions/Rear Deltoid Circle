* Lie down on your chest on a bench and hold one dumbbell in each hand on each side of your hips, arms slightly arched.
* Bring both dumbbells forward until you can see both at the same time and bring them backwards slowly after a short pause.
* Maintain the same small arch in your elbows and keep both dumbbells at the same height from the floor throughout.
