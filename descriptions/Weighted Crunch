* Lie down on your back on a bench and hold a dumbbell on top of your chest.
* Raise your upper body until your shoulder blades no longer touch the bench and lower yourself back down after a short pause.
* To avoid pulling your neck with your hands, look straight up instead of looking at your knees.
