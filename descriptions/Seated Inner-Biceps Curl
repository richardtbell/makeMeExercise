* Sit down on a bench and hold one dumbbell with each hand down the side of your body, palms facing each other.
* Raise both dumbbells until they reach your shoulders' height and slowly lower them back down after a short pause.
* Try NOT to jerk your upper body in an effort to help you lift the weights.
