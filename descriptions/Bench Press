* Lie down on your back on a bench and hold 2 dumbbells at chest level along your body, palms facing your feet.
* Raise the dumbbells straight up until your elbows are close to being locked and lower them back slowly after a short pause.
* Breathe out when raising the dumbbells and breathe in when lowering them back.
