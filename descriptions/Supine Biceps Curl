* Lie down on your back on a bench and hold one dumbbell on each hand on each side of the body, below body height, palms facing up.
* Raise the dumbbells until they reach your body's height and slowly lower them back down after a short pause.
* Breathe out when lifting and breathe in when lowering back.
