* Lie down on your back on a bench and hold the dumbbells on your sides just above your chest, palms facing each other.
* Push the dumbbells straight up until your arms are close to being fully extended and slowly lower them back after a short pause.
* Breathe out when pushing the dumbbells up and breathe out when lowering them back down.
