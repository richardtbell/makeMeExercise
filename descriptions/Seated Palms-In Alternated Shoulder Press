* Sit on a bench and hold two dumbbells, one at shoulder level and the other high with your arm extended, palms facing each other.
* Push one dumbbell straight up until your elbow comes close to locking and lower it back down after a short pause. Alternate hands.
* Be careful NOT to jerk your back in an effort to help you raise the dumbbells.
