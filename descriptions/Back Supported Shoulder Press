* Sit on a bench with support for you back and hold two dumbbells at shoulder level, palms facing each other.
* Raise the dumbbells straight up until your elbows come close to locking and lower them back down after a short pause.
* Be careful NOT to jerk your back in an effort to help you raise the dumbbells.
